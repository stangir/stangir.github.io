## Bioinformatics Analysis of SOD1 G93C Mutation and ALS Prognosis

* **Duration:** Aug 2023 - Dec 2023
* **Description:**

  * Spearheaded a bioinformatics research project analyzing the prognostic significance of the SOD1 G93C mutation in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), employing NCBI, IGV, Ensembl, BioMart, and ENCODE for comprehensive gene characterization and SNP analysis.
  * Utilized advanced bioinformatics tools for data mining and analysis, including Galaxy for UTRs and CDS detection, ClinVar for clinical relevance assessment, and bedtools for NGS data analysis, contributing to the identification of pathogenic SNPs associated with improved ALS prognosis.
  * Applied AutoDock Vina for molecular docking simulations to explore protein-ligand interactions, despite technical challenges, underscoring a multidisciplinary approach to uncovering therapeutic targets in neurodegenerative diseases.
