## Research Technologist

* **Company Name:** [The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine - Brain Science Institute](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/som)
* **Location:** Baltimore, MD, United States
* **Duration:** April 2023 - Present
* **Description:**
  * Performed RNA isolation and qPCR analysis to explore alterations in RNA and nuclear conditions in ALS, to identify novel drug targets, utilizing confocal microscopy for detailed image analysis and ImageJ for image processing.
  * Implemented immunofluorescence techniques on cells isolated from ALS-affected patients to elucidate cellular mechanisms, contributing to a deeper understanding of ALS pathology.
  * Cultured a variety of cell types, including induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), cancer cells, and neuronal stem cells, showcasing my expertise in cell biology and supporting diverse research projects aimed at disease modeling and therapeutic discovery.

## **Graduate Research Assistant**

* **Company Name:** [The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine -Sidney Kimmel Cancer Institute](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/video/johns-hopkins-kimmel-cancer-center-at-sibley-memorial-hospital)
* **Location:** Baltimore, MD, United States
* **Duration:** Jan 2023 - March 2023
* **Description:**
  * Genotyped mice, isolation of brain slices after transcardiac perfusion and fixation of the mice for imaging.
  * Conducted a study on the effects of MRI radiation on brain hemispheres, utilizing ImageJ for precise area comparison and analysis
    between treated and untreated sides. Used Excel for statistical analysis and visualization of data, demonstrating the differential
    impact of MRI radiation on brain hemisphere areas, contributing valuable insights into radiological brain research.


## **Bioinformatics Research Intern**

* **Company Name:** [BIONOME](https://bionome.in/)
* **Location:** Bangalore, India
* **Duration:** Oct 2021 - April 2022
* **Description:**
  * Tested certain potential drug targets for Covid-19, Malaria, and Cancer with the help of virtual screening methods, using Bioinformatic tools and ADMET screening. Also, learnt molecular dynamics using GROMACS and applications of NGS analysis using Illumina.


## **FTD-ALS Project Researcher**

* **Company Name:** [PES University](https://pes.edu/)
* **Location:** Bangalore, India
* **Duration:** Sept 2020 - Oct 2021
* **Description:**
  * Worked extensively on In-silico modelling of the genetic and neuropathological factors of Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD). Created 10 logical pathways of FTD with ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis) as reference. Used CellDesigner tool and collaborated these pathways into a single comprehensive pathway consisting of all the genes, processes, and neuropathology information of FTD.


## **Undergraduate Student Researcher**

* **Company Name:** [PES University](https://pes.edu/)
* **Location:** Bangalore, India
* **Duration:** Sept 2019 - Arpil 2020
* **Description:**
  * Performed quality analysis of carotenoids, Extraction of different types of carotenoids, such as lutein and beta-carotene, from algal biomass and analyzing their role as an antioxidant. Study of different types of carotenoids and their quantification in algal biomass for identifying potential drug targets for cancer.
